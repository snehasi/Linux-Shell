The input command is read using fgets in an infinite while loop, it's parsed then using string function strtok. If the command
matches "exit", the while loop breaks. The newline character is removed. The null chracter is appended at the end of the array
formed. After that if fork() is 0, execvp() is run with the parameters as the file pointer and the command. Else the while loop does wait().
Internal commands-
history-strdup() creates a copy of the given parameter and returns pointer to the copy.
